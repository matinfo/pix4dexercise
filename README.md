Pix4D Exercise - Maintain inventory of *drone* and *camera*
###########################################################

Needs to implement a small web application for the inventory of its drones and cameras. The application will include the following features:

1. A web page to register a new drone. Whenever a new drone arrives to the company, someone from the support team will use the feature to register it by adding all the needed data. This should include at least: name, brand, serial number, different type of supported cameras (ex: phantom, DJI, x4303,hero3). The camera’s main parameters are the model, megapixel number and the brand (ex: hero3, 12MP,gopro).

2. A web page to see the list of drones registered. In this page it could help also to have some kind of filtering (e.g. by name, brand, camera megapixel, etc) as well as the ability to change the order of the results.
Note that the whole company should be able to see the list, but only support member should be able to register a new drone.
